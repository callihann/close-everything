# close-everything 
Simple utility that closes all running processes using the windows.h library.

## running
### building from source
Use whatever c++ compiler you have access to, eg g++ and compile to a binary.
```bash
g++ -o main.exe .\main.cpp 
```
### running 
Run from a precompiled binary, such as the ones listed under releases.

## todo
- [ ] ensure the program is always running
- [ ] listen for key press
- [ ] use cronjobs or task scheduler for persistence
